demo : [Watch the video](https://youtu.be/gGjzxM555AI?feature=shared)

This project is a web-based task management system that allows users to log in and view their assigned tasks. The system uses a servlet to fetch tasks from the database based on the user's ID and displays them on a JSP page. Users can see their tasks in a structured table format after logging in, making task management simple and efficient.

There are 2 roles for the users: admin and user. Admin can see the list of users and can assign the task to them and also can see what task is assigned to them. There are two tables are used: Users and Task, Users will contain the user information and Task table will have list of tasks of registered users. This is how the tables will looks like:
